# Probabilistic Approach To Thermal Equilibrium
The purpose of this project was to apply the Monte Carlo Algorithm to a Linear Algebra Project that aimed at identifying the temperatures at a point in a metal plate, when its sides were heated. Assuming the discrete mean value property, the Monte Carlo Algorithm states that the temperature at a point within the metal plate is an average of the temperatures encountered by a random path drawn from that point. Over many iterations, which can be specified by the user (usually 1000+), the algorithm produces a temperature similar to that found through Linear Algebraic Approaches.
